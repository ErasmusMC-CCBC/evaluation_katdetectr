## Introduction

This repository contains all the custom scripts used in the evaluation and comparison of [katdetectr](https://github.com/ErasmusMC-CCBC/katdetectr/) as described in the corresponding [manuscript](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.11.499364v3) (*currently under review*).

## Reproducibility

All produced input and output for reproduction of the evaluation of kataegis detection packages as detailed within our manuscript were deposited on [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6810477).

The evaluation of the kataegis detection can be reproduced by following the Jupyter notebook available in the `notebooks` directory. The notebook can be run locally or viewed online on [GitHub](https://github.com/ErasmusMC-CCBC/evaluation_katdetectr/blob/main/notebooks/1.EvaluatePackages.ipynb).
